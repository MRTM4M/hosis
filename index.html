                        produced in 1628 by the English 
                        Parliament and sent to Charles I 
                        as a statement of civil liberties.  
                        Refusal by Parliament to finance the king's 
                        unpopular foreign policy had caused his 
                        government to exact forced loans and to quarter 
                        troops in subjects' houses as an economy measure. 
                        Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment for opposing 
                        these policies had produced in Parliament a violent 
                        hostility to Charles and to George Villiers, the Duke 
                        of Buckingham.The Petition of Right, initiated by Sir Edward Coke, 
                        was based upon earlier statutes and charters and

                <div class="paragraph">Ethical dilemmas in bioinformatics arise mainly from handling sensitive medical and genetic data. Such data has the power to greatly benefit society, but it also carries significant risks related to privacy violations</div>

                    <div class="paragraph_point">Protecting sensitive genetic and personal information from unauthorized access is a core ethical requirement. This includes preventing misuse by third parties such as insurance companies. Achieving this requires data anonymization, strict access control mechanisms, and strong security regulations to ensure that only authorized individuals can handle such data.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="point">
                    <div class="heading_point">Informed Consent</div>
                    <div class="paragraph_point">Individuals must fully understand how their genetic data will be used, stored, and shared before providing it for research or analysis. Informed consent ensures respect for personal autonomy and protects individuals from unexpected or unwanted uses of their data.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="point">
                    <div class="heading_point">Transparency</div>
                    <div class="paragraph_point">Researchers and institutions must maintain open communication about their research practices, data handling methods, and intended uses of genetic information. Transparency builds trust and allows participants to make informed decisions about contributing their data.</div>

                <div class="point">
                    <div class="heading_point">Equity and Fair Use</div>
                    <div class="paragraph_point">Bioinformatics data should be used in ways that benefit society as a whole without exploiting vulnerable groups. A major challenge is the lack of diversity in genetic databases, which are often dominated by samples of European ancestry. This imbalance can create biased results and limit the global benefit of scientific findings</div>

                    <div class="paragraph_point">Human dignity, recognized as the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace, is central to bioinformatics. Ethical practice requires treating every individual with respect as a moral and rational being. This includes protecting genetic data from exploitation, discrimination, or harmful use. Bioinformatics research should aim to improve human health and well-being, aligning with the fundamental right to life.</div>

                <div class="point">
                    <div class="heading_point">The Right to Liberty and Privacy</div>
                    <div class="paragraph_point">Privacy and autonomy are core human rights. Protecting the confidentiality of personal and genetic data reflects these rights. Violating genetic privacy can expose individuals to harmful or hostile responses from society, limiting their freedom. Therefore, informed consent and secure data handling are essential components of respecting human liberty.</div>

                    <div class="paragraph_point">Human rights include equality before the law and the prohibition of discrimination. Historical documents such as the Magna Carta emphasized equal legal treatment, while the Cyrus Cylinder highlighted early principles of ethnic equality</div>

                <div class="point">
                    <div class="heading_point">Protection from Arbitrary Intervention</div>
                    <div class="paragraph_point">Historical legal documents—such as the Magna Carta (1215) and the Petition of Right (1628)—established protections against arbitrary government actions, including unlawful imprisonment and taxation without consent. In bioinformatics, collecting or analyzing genetic data without consent or adequate security constitutes a form of arbitrary interference. Ethical practices must therefore rely on clear legal and moral frameworks to safeguard individuals from harm, misuse, or unauthorized access to their data.</div>
